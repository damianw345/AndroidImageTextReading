# Androract

This is a student team project which assumes creating application which will read text from photo taken or loaded by the Android device. 

To achieve our goal we used libraries such as:

- Text recognition library: Tesseract-OCR https://github.com/tesseract-ocr
- Training data for recognizing fonts in different languages: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata
- Manual image cropping module: https://github.com/edmodo/cropper

OCR works when taken photo is in very good quality (e.g. shop receipt with black letters on white background).

Application isn't under active development
