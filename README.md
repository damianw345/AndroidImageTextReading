This is a student team project which assumes creating application which will read text from from photo taken by the Android device. 

To achieve our goal we plan to use libraries such as:

- Text recognition library: Tesseract-OCR https://github.com/tesseract-ocr
- Image processing library: openCV https://opencv.org
